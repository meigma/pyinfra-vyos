## 2026-08-15 12:54 — Kickoff
Goal for the session: implement wave 2 as documented in session 001 — typed
operations for pyinfra-vyos, per the seam in `.journal/001/ARCHITECTURE.md` §5
and candidates in `.journal/001/RESEARCH.md`.
Current state of the world: wave 1 shipped and hardware-verified on `main`
(config_load op, Version/Configuration/ConfigurationCommands facts, vbash
session substrate, @local + appliance test tiers, Lima lab, release pipeline
live; release PR #7 for 0.1.0 open awaiting human decision).
Plan: review ARCHITECTURE.md §5 seam and RESEARCH.md wave-2 candidates, scope
the typed-operation set with the user, then design/implement/verify in an
isolated implementation worktree.
